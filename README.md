# My FreeCodeCamp projects

I started FreeCodeCamp some time ago but various personal challenges and a somewhat short attention span drove me away several times from the great project.

After experimenting with GitHub through the JavaScript30 course, I now want to keep my FCC projects right here, not just on CodePen.

These are my current projects:

[Weather App](https://github.com/andreidbr/FCC/tree/master/WeatherApp)

[Wikipedia Viewer](https://github.com/andreidbr/FCC/tree/master/WikiViewer)

[Twitch Checker](https://github.com/andreidbr/FCC/tree/master/TwitchCheck)

[JS Calculator](https://github.com/andreidbr/FCC/tree/master/JSCalc)

[Pomodoro Clock](https://github.com/andreidbr/FCC/tree/master/Pomodoro)

[TicTacToe Game](https://github.com/andreidbr/FCC/tree/master/TicTacToe)
