# FCC Weather App
A weather application that is capable of geolocation and forecast information

## Lessons learned

This application was certainly a clear example of easier said than done. I thought you just had to plug in some APIs, write a bit of JS, and then voila, everything worked as intended.

After many, many, many tabs with documentation, Stack Overflow, and probably one point where I thought about shutting everything down, the project came together and things started working.
