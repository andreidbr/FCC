# FCC Twitch Checker
A website that checks the status of several Twitch channels

## Lessons learned

In terms of actual functionality, this website wasn't that complicated. It took a bit of experimentation to see which route to use with the API endpoint but, in the end, I went with two paths that accomodate both online and offline channels.

Things were much trickier with the CSS, as I initially went with nested flexboxes that proved to be very problematic. As such, I just went with a single flexbox and some static positioning for other elements. It also took a bit of experimentation to see how to align the text and user avatars so that they look nice.
