## Lessons learned

For this project, I went back to my previous experience with the JavaScript 30 course from Wes Bos, as he built a similar timer, albeit with some key differences, for lesson 29.

As such, I grabbed some of the code from that exercise and, of course, customized it to reflect current needs. It felt a bit weird to use vanilla JavaScript after building previous projects using jQuery, but I quickly got into the groove.

I may refact some of the code and add some extra features, like an option to enforce Pomodoro (1:5) ratio on the time values entered by users. But that is a battle for another day.
